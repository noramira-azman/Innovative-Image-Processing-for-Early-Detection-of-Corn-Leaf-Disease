# Innovative-Image-Processing-for-Early-Detection-of-Corn-Leaf-Disease
CSC566 Group Project

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying corn leaf diseases using advanced image processing techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to assist in early detection of common corn diseases, improving crop health monitoring and agricultural productivity.

The project implements three image processing techniques:
1. Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE)
2. Canny Edge Detection
3. Texture Feature Extraction

A CNN model was trained and evaluated on the processed images to classify diseases such as Blight, Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, and Healthy Leaves.

## Dataset
The Corn or Maize Leaf Disease Dataset was used for this project.
Source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smaranjitghose/corn-or-maize-leaf-disease-dataset/data)

## CNN Code Reference
The CNN implementation was inspired by the work detailed in this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mdismielhossenabir/corn-or-maize-leaf-disease).

## Report
A detailed report on the methods, implementation, and results is included in this repository as a reference for further understanding.
